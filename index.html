  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <img src="https://www.tripadvisor.com/LocationPhotos-g147288-Dominican_Republic.html" alt="Dominican Republic scenic" class="hero">
  <p>
    Since the assassination of dictator Rafael Trujillo in 1961, the Dominican Republic has transitioned
    from an agricultural economy to a tourism-driven development model. This transformation
    brought rapid growth while also exposing structural vulnerabilities.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="background">
  <h2>Historical Background</h2>
  <p>
    From 1930 to 1961, Rafael Trujillo’s regime tightly controlled the economy. Its collapse opened the
    country to foreign investment and large-scale tourism development, reshaping the Dominican
    Republic’s economic path.
  </p>

<section id="tourism">
  <h2>Tourism as Economic Driver</h2>

  <p>
    Tourism is one of the Dominican Republic’s most important economic sectors. Over 10 million visitors
    arrived in 2023, making it the most visited Caribbean destination and accounting for around 11.6%
    of GDP. :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}
  </p>
  <p>
    In 2024, the tourism sector contributed roughly $20.5 billion to GDP and created over 876,000 jobs—
    about 17% of total employment. :contentReference[oaicite:1]{index=1}
  </p>

<section id="inequality">
  <h2>Inequality & Labor</h2>
  <img src="https://www.vecteezy.com/free-photos/dominican-republic-tourism" alt="Tourism and labor in Dominican Republic">
  <p>
    Although tourism fuels national growth, it has not benefited all communities equally. Wealth is
    concentrated in coastal regions, while rural areas and Haitian migrant workers often remain in
    low-wage jobs without sufficient protections.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="climate">
  <h2>Climate Change & Vulnerability</h2>
  <img src="https://stock.adobe.com/search?k=dominican+republic+hurricane" alt="Dominican Republic hurricane damage">
  <p>
    The Dominican Republic is highly exposed to climate impacts like hurricanes, floods, and sea-level
    rise. Its location in the hurricane belt frequently damages coastal infrastructure and tourism
    resources. :contentReference[oaicite:2]{index=2}
  </p>
  <p>
    To address these risks, the country is pursuing climate adaptation strategies including coastal
    protection and renewable energy investment. :contentReference[oaicite:3]{index=3}
  </p>
</section>

<section id="dependency">
  <h2>Postcolonial Dependency</h2>
  <p>
    Tourism-led growth has reinforced economic dependency on foreign capital and global markets. Many
    resorts and tourism services are foreign owned, with profits largely repatriated abroad, limiting
    domestic wealth accumulation and economic sovereignty.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="policy">
  <h2>Policy & Future Outlook</h2>
  <p>
    The Dominican government has tried to diversify with policies aimed at renewable energy, free-trade
    zones, and sustainable tourism. These efforts can reduce vulnerability, but climate risks and
    inequality remain critical challenges.
  </p>
</section>

<section id="conclusion">
  <h2>Conclusion</h2>
  <p>
    The Dominican Republic’s experience highlights both the opportunities and risks associated with
    tourism-driven growth. Sustainable and inclusive economic strategies are essential for lasting
    resilience in the face of global challenges.
